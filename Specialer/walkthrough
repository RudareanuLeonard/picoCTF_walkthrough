So, as soon as you start this challange, you can observe that no "normal" commands work.

How can you see what "commands" you have access to? By simply double tapping "tab".

Now that you see those, we'll mainly use "cd" and "echo".

If we use "cd" we can observe that we have multiple folders. Now, go through each of them and try to see their txt files output by using echo - echo (<$name_of_file).

Do this until you find the flag!
