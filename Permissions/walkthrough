Can you read files in the root file?

How can you do that if su does not work?

Well, there are some techniques to bypass local security restrictions.

First of all, use "sudo -l" to see where you have root permission. You'll see there's "vi".

And according to "https://gtfobins.github.io/" (thank you for this), there is an "exploit" to get user privileges by using "vi".
More exactly, you create a vi folder and write ":!/bin/bash" (execute /bin/bash command using vi). Then you get root privilege.
After that, you can change to /root and find your hidden file flag
